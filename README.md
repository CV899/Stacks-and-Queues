# Stacks-and-Queues

A simple project I created to practice implementing stacks and queues. 

The stack class records entries as well as keep track of the current minimum and maxmimum entries in the stack using three arrays.
The linked queue class is implemented using simple arrays. The fixed capacity issue is addressed by 
adding additional arrays as needed.
